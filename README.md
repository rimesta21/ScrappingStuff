Scrapping Scripts for Practice

Email script was supposed to sign the user into google and send a message. Google caught on and now won't let me sign in because it's not secure :( I've changes account settings and even went into the hex editor to change the driver but still no workaround. The script works though. I was able to run it before Google caught on.

Pictures script goes onto Flickr, searches, and downloads first x number of pictures (the search term and x are received from the user). The script also recognizes ads and skips them when necessary.
